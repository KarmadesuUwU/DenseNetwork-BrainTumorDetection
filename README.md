- This CNN uses the Densely Coonnected Neural Networks architecture to connect all layers within the denseblocks  
- The data is prepared with random rotatiional and flips transformations  
- The data is prepared with single channel graayscale images transformation

Some tests

- The model is build with 1 channel and a classic block configuration (6, 12, 24, 16) of 4 Denseblocks  
- The model achieved 97% of accuracy with the next training parameters:
   
  Dataloaders with a batch size of 32:
    
    *Number of samples:  4148*  
    *Training samples:  2904*  
    *Validation samples:  1244*  

  Training parameters:  

    *Epochs: 15*   
    *Criterterion: Cross Entropy Loss*   
    *Optimizer: Adam*    
    *Learning Rate upadater: ReduceLROnPlateau*  

- The model is ready to use for detecting brain tumors in MR Scans
